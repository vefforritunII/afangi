# Git & GitHub Project Step-by-Step Guide

The guide is divided into four main phases:

1. **Initial setup (done once per project)**
2. **Scrum sprint planning (TO DO)**
3. **Developing an issue (In Progress)**
4. **Completing work on GitHub (Done)**

## 1️⃣ Initial Setup (Done Once)

**Step 1: Create GitHub repository and add collaborators**

1. Log in to GitHub and create a new repository.
2. Add collaborators and the teacher (read access) to the repository.

---

**Step 2: Create a GitHub Project**

1. Click the **Projects** tab in the repository.
2. Create a new Project using the **Team planning** template with columns: `TO DO`, `In Progress`, `Done`.

## 2️⃣ Scrum Sprint Planning (TO DO) – All Team Members

**Step 3: Move items to TO DO column**

* At the start of the sprint, drag items you plan to work on into the **TO DO** column.

---

**Step 4: Convert items into Issues**

1. Click the three dots on a Project item.
2. Select **Convert to Issue**.
3. Note the issue number (e.g., `#1`).

---

**Step 5: Assign repository to the Issue**

* Open the Issue and select the repository it belongs to.

---

**Step 6: Assign Issues to developers**

* Open the Issue and assign it to a developer.

---

## 3️⃣ Developing an Issue (In Progress)

**Step 7: Move items to In Progress column**

* Once work starts, move the issue to the **In Progress** column.

---

**Step 8: Create a new branch from `main`**

* Create a branch named `issue#n` (where `n` is the issue number).
  Example: `issue#1`

---

**Step 9: Work on the issue locally**

* Implement the required changes in your project files.
* Save your changes and prepare them to be committed.

---

## 4️⃣ Completing Work on GitHub (Done)

**Step 10: Merge issue branch into main**

1. Merge the `issue#n` branch into `main`.
2. Keep the branch after merging.
3. Move the Issue card to **Done**.
